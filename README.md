# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

## Company Details

- **Company**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
- **Name**: SHERLIN MARY N  
- **Intern ID**: CT08NKX  
- **Domain**: MACHINE LEARNING 
- **Duration**: 4 WEEKS  
- **Mentor**: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR  

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of a **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Matrix Factorization** in **Google Colab** as part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**. The objective of this project was to build a recommendation engine that suggests items based on user preferences.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Used**: MovieLens / Custom Dataset
- **Libraries Used**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Surprise`, `Matplotlib`
- **Approaches Used**:
  - **Collaborative Filtering** (User-based and Item-based)
  - **Matrix Factorization** (SVD, SVD++, NMF)
  - **Evaluation using RMSE & MAE**
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values
  - Normalization and encoding categorical variables
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
- **Model Training**:
  - Built recommendation models using **Surprise Library**
  - Tuned hyperparameters for better predictions
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Top-N Recommendation Performance

## Output

Below are some visualizations from the implementation:

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Open the `RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
3. Run all the cells sequentially to execute the recommendation system model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn surprise matplotlib
```

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in building a **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Matrix Factorization**. The model effectively suggested items based on user behavior. Future improvements could involve integrating **Deep Learning** techniques like **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** or using **Hybrid Recommendation Models** for enhanced performance.
